# Feed Reader Project Overview

This project mainly focuses on testing javascript code using Jasmine. Testing is performed using different tests. Testing of our logic becomes important when you are adding any new feature in the application. Udacity emphasizes the importance of code testing as a Front End Web Developer.


## Test Performed

* RSS Feeds

It must have URl' loops through each feed and it should not be empty. It must have name'loops through each fedd and it should not be empty.

* The menu

It should be hidden by default. It should open and close by clicking on the hamburger button.

* Initial Entries

When loadFeed function is called and completes its work, there should be at least one .entry element within .feed container.

*New Feed Selection

Should change the contents when new feed is loaded.


## What will I learn?

You will learn how to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application. These will test the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.


## How will this help my career?

Writing effective tests requires analyzing multiple aspects of an application including the HTML, CSS and JavaScript - an extremely important skill when changing teams or joining a new company.

Good tests give you the ability to quickly analyze whether new code breaks an existing feature within your codebase, without having to manually test all of the functionality.
